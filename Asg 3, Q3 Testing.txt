Code: 
test_1 = bisection_zero([1, -7, 10], 1, 4)
test_2 = bisection_zero([2, -13, 22, -8], -1, 1.5)
test_3 = bisection_zero([8, 0, 0, -1], -1, 3)
test_4 = bisection_zero([1, 1], 3, 1)
test_5 = bisection_zero([1, -6, -5, 90, -176, 96], -6, 12)

Test Values:
test #  |            f_x            |  a_0, b_0  |  zero_f
--------+---------------------------+------------+---------
1       |[1, -7, 10]                |1, 4        |2.000
2       |[2, -13, 22, -8]           |-1, 1.5     |0.500
3       |[8, 0, 0, -1]              |-1, 3       |0.500
4       |[1, 1]                     |3, 1        |-1.000
5       |[1, -6, -5, 90, -176, 96]  |-6, 12      |3.000

I chose to test #1-3 because I would be able to compare the values from my function to the correct ones in the assignment page
Then, I chose to try #4 to see how the function would perform with only one root in the function. Lastly, I chose to try #5 to see how the function would perform in a larger function that has multiple roots.
